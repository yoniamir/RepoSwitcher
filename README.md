# RepoSwitcher

**Easily find and open your repositories!**


If you are working on mutliple repositories like me, you want to quickly open a repo from sublime text.
Instead of using terminal or Finder, simply open your repository from Sublime Text!

Sublime Text will autocomplete and open any of your folders in your projects folder.

## 
1. Install the RepoSwitcher via Package Control (Cmd+Shift+P -> Package Control: Install Package -> RepoSwitcher).
1. Once installation done, open your `~/.bash_profile` file. (via Terminal: `sub ~/.bash_profile`)
2. Add an environment variable named CODE_DIR pointing to your projects directory (e.g. `export CODE_DIR='/Users/$USER/MyProjectsDir'`).
3. Restart sublime.
4. All set! Hit Ctrl+O to launch switcher and fly up into the sky.


Enjoy!
